# Is You cat

Different ways to produce Cat Detection Neural Network for Embedded device.

## OneClassTraining
Implementation of the method described here https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.08688.pdf.
## PytorchPretrainedNetworks
Tests of pretrained mobile neural networks in Pytorch which were later exported by torch.jit.trace and onnx.
## Pruning
Tests of model pruning to reduce the size of models.
## TensorflowTraining
Tests of pretrained mobile neural networks in Tensorflow which were later exported by Tensorflow Lite.
## MotionDetector
Motion Detection using phase alignment and middle network representation to reduce the amount of full forward passes.
